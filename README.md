## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later  
- MySQL Server running locally or remotely  
- Maven  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-backend.git
cd task-management-backend
````

2. Configure your MySQL database and update connection details in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/taskdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

3. Build and run the application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## Configuration

The app uses JWT for stateless authentication. Configure these properties in `application.properties`:

```properties
jwt.secret=YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_SECRET_KEY
jwt.expiration-ms=86400000  # Token expiration in milliseconds (1 day)
```

Use a strong secret key for production environments.

* Passwords are stored encrypted using BCrypt.
* Users can only access and manage their own tasks.
